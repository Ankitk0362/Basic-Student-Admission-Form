# Basic-Student-Admission-Form

This HTML code represents a Student Admission Form that collects comprehensive personal, contact, parental, academic, and course-related details from the applicant. The form includes various input fields such as name, date of birth, gender, nationality, contact numbers, email addresses, and academic history.

When the user clicks the Submit button, a JavaScript function named handlesubmit() is triggered. This function shows a pop-up alert saying:

"Thank you, your submission is recorded".

Currently, the form does not redirect to another page after submission. If desired, the function can be modified to do so.

The form includes HTML5 features like required fields to enforce validation and structured input types like date, email, number, and select dropdowns to improve user experience and data accuracy.
